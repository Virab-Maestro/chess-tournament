## How to start a project
The app doesn't have built in server so the easiest way to run it is to use your IDE's live server plugin. E.g. for Visual Studio it would be "live server".

1. clone this project
2. use your IDE's live server plugin to run this project from a local server or simply open index.html file in the browser
